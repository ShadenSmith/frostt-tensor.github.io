The **F**ormidable **R**epository of **O**pen **S**parse **T**ensors and
**T**ools. FROSTT is a collection of publicly available sparse tensor datasets
and tools. FROSTT has two primary objectives:

  1. **Foster sparse tensor research.** Tensors are found in a variety of data
  sources and are difficult to collect, pre-process, and analyze. FROSTT
  addresses these challenges by providing a central location to access datasets
  and a platform of tools to perform analysis.

  2. **Promote reproducible research.** FROSTT provides a globally consistent
  set of tensors, enabling the reproduction and verification of published
  results.
